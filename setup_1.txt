**Use the following commands in the command line**:

cd /etc/network

**Copy the existing interfaces file as a backup**

sudo cp interfaces interfaces-wifi

**Create a new file for our ad-hoc network**

sudo nano interfaces-adhoc

**Once this file is open, copy the code snippet below**:

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
iface eth0 inet dhcp

auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet static
address 192.168.1.1
netmask 255.255.255.0
wireless-channel 1
wireless-essid RPwireless
wireless-mode ad-hoc

**Save the file**

**Now we have a interfaces-wifi and interfaces-adhoc files in the /etc/network**
**We can now switch between using a wireless connection and our ad-hoc network by
simply copying the appropriate file over to the interfaces file.**

**Now if you want to use the ad-hoc network do the following**

sudo cp /etc/network/interfaces-adhoc interfaces

**To switch back to a wifi network do the following:**

sudo cp /etc/network/interfaces-wifi interfaces

**THIS IS WHERE THINGS CHANGE FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES, NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE CORRECT STEPS ARE.**

**Install a package to allow the Pi to assign a device connecting to it an IP
address**

Web Source 1.   sudo apt-get update
		sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server 

**That created a config file that needs to be edited.**
**Now access the file**

sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf

**Edit the file to only contain the following: **

ddns-update-style interim;

default-lease-time 600;

max-lease-time 7200;

authoritative;

log-facility local7;

subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {

range 192.168.1.5 192.168.1.150;

}

**Save this config file and reboot**
